## Project Overview

This project implements a **cloud-native movie recommendation system** using the **MovieLens dataset** and **Kafka streaming** for real-time personalization.  
The model employs **collaborative filtering (KNN, SVD)** to predict user–item preferences and serves recommendations through a **FastAPI microservice** deployed on **Google Cloud Run**.

**Goal:** Deliver real-time, scalable, and monitored recommendations that maintain reliability, low latency, and data consistency.

**Service-Level Objectives (SLOs):**
- **Latency (p95):** ≤ 400 ms  
- **Uptime:** ≥ 99.5 %  
- **Accuracy:** ≥ baseline F1 score

## Architecture Summary

**Core Components:**
- **FastAPI Service** – Serves `/recommend`, `/healthz`, and `/metrics` endpoints.  
- **Kafka Topics** – Handle user activity and rating streams.  
- **Schema Registry** – Maintains data schema consistency.  
- **Model Service** – Generates predictions using stored model versions.  
- **GCS Storage** – Persists datasets, model artifacts, and logs.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** – GitHub Actions for test → build → push → deploy.  
- **Monitoring Stack** – Prometheus + Grafana Cloud dashboards.
